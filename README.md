The goal for this project was to combine the "choose your own adventure" assignment with a GUI from simpleGE
>To play, player chooses between two presented options by clicking on either of the option buttons.

>Process description:
What did you learn?
  >Through developing this game, I was able to learn that often times codig can be like a puzzle.
   When figuring out what you want the game to do, you kind of have to piece together what functions and statements to use to make it all come together in the way you want. Though, sometimes its mdifficult when trying to combine two different
   concepts (game concepts) into one. Especially when some elements were introduced in a new way. This specific assignment was a lot of trial and error to make it work.


Where did you get stuck?
  >I mainly got stuck on how to take the game functions of the choose your own adventure game and implement that into a game that relied on on-screen interaction versus the user inputs that we used before.
  I also struggled figuring out how to get the MultiLabel to work exactly how I wanted it to (it made my game crash when I messed with it too much, so I gave up)
  I also struggled a bit figuring out how to get sound files to work properly (I figured it out though!).

What would you like to improve?
  >I would mostly like to get a better understanding of how to go about coding these type of programs more. I was able to figure out a bit on my own with major trial and error, but I would like to be able to minimize that time spent just doing something
  until something worked.

How would you do things differently next time?
  >I would definitely try asking for help earlier on, as well as possibly being more clear with what I wanted to happen so that I wouldn't over complicate things for myself and causing confusion.

How far did you stray from the game design document?
  >I don't think I strayed far from it, other than taking my introduction scene out of the code (sort of). I mostlly just strayed by adding my game title to my background and addding in background music, as well as adding color to the main text box for aesthetics.

How did you stay on track?
  >I mostlly followed my game document exactly as I planned, with a few additional things.
